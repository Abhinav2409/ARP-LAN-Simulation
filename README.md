# ARP-LAN-Simulation
"ARP LAN simulation project using Cisco Packet Tracer"
This project demonstrates the use of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) within a simple LAN environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. By connecting four PCs to an 8-port switch and assigning unique IP addresses, the simulation shows how ARP enables devices to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses for successful local communication. The project includes step-by-step configuration, observation of ARP table updates, and visualization of packet exchanges in simulation mode.
